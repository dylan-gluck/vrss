# Estimated Timeline

**Total Duration: 8-12 weeks**

| Phase | Duration | Team Size | Notes |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | 1-2 weeks | 2-3 devs | Infrastructure, database, testing setup |
| **Phase 2: Authentication** | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 devs | Better-auth, email verification, middleware |
| **Phase 3: Backend API** | 3-4 weeks | 2-3 devs | 10 routers, 50+ procedures (parallelizable) |
| **Phase 4: Frontend Foundation** | 2-3 weeks | 2-3 devs | PWA, state, RPC client, auth UI |
| **Phase 5: Core Features** | 3-4 weeks | 3-4 devs | Feed, profile, messages, notifications (parallelizable) |
| **Phase 6: Advanced Features** | 2-3 weeks | 2-3 devs | Algorithm builder, search, offline sync |
| **Phase 7: Polish & Launch** | 1-2 weeks | 2-3 devs | Performance, accessibility, security, docs |

**Critical Path:** Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (auth, user, post) → Phase 4 → Phase 5

**Parallelization Opportunities:**
- Phase 3: Multiple routers (message, notification, discovery, settings) can be built in parallel
- Phase 4 & 5: Frontend features can be built alongside backend routers
- Phase 6: Algorithm builder, search, and offline sync are independent
- Phase 7: Performance, accessibility, and security audits can run in parallel

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope:**
- Phases 1-5 = Core MVP (6-8 weeks)
- Phase 6-7 = Enhanced MVP (additional 2-4 weeks)
