✅ Get user profile by username: <10ms (indexed)
✅ List posts with pagination (50 posts): <50ms
✅ Execute feed algorithm with 3 filters: <100ms
✅ Search users by username prefix: <50ms (full-text search)
✅ Get follower count: <10ms (cached or materialized view)
```

**Load Testing Scenarios:**
- **Concurrent users**: 100 users browsing feeds simultaneously
- **Post creation load**: 10 posts created per second
- **File upload load**: 5 concurrent 5MB file uploads
- **Search load**: 50 search queries per second
- **Notification delivery**: 1000 notifications sent in 10 seconds

### 6. Security Testing Coverage

**Target:** All security scenarios validated

**Authentication Security Tests:**
```gherkin
✅ Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 10+)
✅ Session tokens are cryptographically secure (32+ bytes entropy)
✅ Session tokens expire after configured timeout (30 days default)
✅ Failed login attempts are rate-limited (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
✅ Brute force attacks are detected and blocked
✅ Session hijacking is prevented with CSRF tokens
✅ Session fixation is prevented (new token after login)
```

**Authorization Security Tests:**
```gherkin
✅ Private profiles are not accessible to non-followers
✅ Users cannot edit other users' profiles
✅ Users cannot delete other users' posts
✅ API endpoints enforce authentication requirements
✅ Admin-only endpoints reject non-admin users
✅ File uploads require authentication
✅ Direct message access is restricted to conversation participants
```

**Input Validation Security Tests:**
```gherkin
✅ SQL injection attempts are prevented (parameterized queries)
✅ XSS attacks are prevented (content sanitization)
✅ Script tag injection in post content is blocked
✅ HTML in user input is escaped before rendering
✅ File upload MIME type validation prevents malicious files
✅ File upload size limits prevent DoS attacks
✅ Rate limiting prevents API abuse
```

**Data Protection Security Tests:**
```gherkin
✅ Passwords are never logged or exposed in responses
✅ Session tokens are never logged or exposed in URLs
✅ Email addresses are not exposed in public profiles
✅ Private posts are not visible in public feeds
✅ Deleted posts are purged from database (not soft-deleted)
✅ User data export includes all user's data (GDPR)
✅ User account deletion removes all associated data
```

**Security Headers Tests:**
```gherkin
✅ Content-Security-Policy header prevents inline scripts
✅ X-Frame-Options header prevents clickjacking
✅ X-Content-Type-Options header prevents MIME sniffing
✅ Strict-Transport-Security header enforces HTTPS
✅ Referrer-Policy header controls referrer information
✅ Permissions-Policy header restricts browser features
```

## Coverage Metrics and Reporting

### Coverage Thresholds

| Component | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Function Coverage |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Backend Services** | 90%+ | 85%+ | 95%+ |
| **Backend Controllers** | 85%+ | 80%+ | 90%+ |
| **Frontend Components** | 80%+ | 75%+ | 85%+ |
| **Frontend Utils** | 90%+ | 85%+ | 95%+ |
| **Overall Project** | **80%+** | **75%+** | **85%+** |

### Critical Paths Requiring 100% Coverage

1. **Authentication flows**: Registration, login, logout, session validation
2. **Storage quota management**: Calculation, enforcement, upgrade checks
3. **Data integrity operations**: Post creation, deletion, user data cleanup
4. **Security checks**: Authorization, input sanitization, CSRF validation
5. **Payment processing** (when implemented in future)

### Coverage Reporting

```bash
# Backend coverage report
cd packages/backend
bun test --coverage
open coverage/index.html

# Frontend coverage report
cd packages/frontend
bun test --coverage
open coverage/index.html

# E2E coverage (via Playwright)
cd packages/e2e
bunx playwright test --reporter=html
bunx playwright show-report
```

### Coverage Gaps and Remediation

**When coverage falls below threshold:**
1. Identify uncovered code paths in coverage report
2. Determine if code is critical, edge case, or error handling
3. Write targeted tests for uncovered paths
4. If code is unreachable, refactor or remove

**Exclude from coverage:**
- Generated code (Prisma client, API types)
- Configuration files (next.config.js, playwright.config.ts)
- Development-only code (mock data, storybook stories)
- Third-party library wrappers (minimal business logic)

## Test Data Management

### Fixtures and Test Personas

**Predefined User Personas** (from PRD):
```typescript
// packages/backend/test/fixtures/personas.ts
export const PERSONA_CREATOR = {
  username: 'maya_music',
  email: 'maya@example.com',
  storageUsed: 30_000_000, // 30MB
  storageQuota: 50_000_000, // 50MB
  profileType: 'creator',
  postsCount: 45,
  followersCount: 1250,
  followingCount: 180
};

export const PERSONA_CONSUMER = {
  username: 'marcus_consumer',
  email: 'marcus@example.com',
  storageUsed: 5_000_000, // 5MB
  storageQuota: 50_000_000, // 50MB
  profileType: 'consumer',
  postsCount: 8,
  followersCount: 80,
  followingCount: 320
};

export const PERSONA_BUSINESS = {
  username: 'jade_cafe',
  email: 'jade@example.com',
  storageUsed: 45_000_000, // 45MB (near limit)
  storageQuota: 50_000_000, // 50MB
  profileType: 'business',
  postsCount: 120,
  followersCount: 2500,
  followingCount: 50
};
```

### Test Data Builders

```typescript
// Builder pattern for flexible test data creation
const user = await new UserBuilder()
  .withUsername('testuser')
  .withEmail('test@example.com')
  .withStorageUsed(30_000_000)
  .withStorageQuota(50_000_000)
  .create();

const post = await new PostBuilder()
  .withAuthor(user.id)
  .withType('image')
  .withContent('Test post content')
  .withFileSize(5_000_000)
  .create();
```

### Database Seeding for E2E Tests

```bash
# Seed test database with realistic data
bun run seed:test-db

# Seed includes:
# - 3 user personas (creator, consumer, business)
# - 100 posts across various types
# - 50 follow relationships
# - 20 custom feeds
# - 30 notifications
```
